# GameLauncher

GameLauncher School project with a little bit of webscraping.

One of our school projects is to build a simple gamelauncher with some features.

It must have a user GUI You can add "Games" (can be just a local program like notepad), edit "games". You can start the "game" from the Gamelauncher I added a few features. There is also a webscraper coded, but it only works if you change the Steamgames Folder string with your own Steamgames folder.
